## Example setup for node.js and mocha

We are developing a package for converting roman numerals (stings)
into javascript Numbers.  You can find some code already in roman.js.

To use this package you import it as shown in index.js.  run

    npm start

to run index.js with node.


To test the package there are some test cases in test.js. first run

   npm install

to install mocha, and then run

   npm test

to run the tests.

Now you can develop the rest of the roman.js package.
